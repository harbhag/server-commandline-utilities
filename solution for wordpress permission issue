Can't upload images to WordPress
The error says:
"Unable to create directory /wp-content/uploads//. Is its parent directory writable by the server?"
Many people have written various articles about this error and some of them are really security vulnerable.
Here I provide a more secure solution.

WARNING: There are a lot of articles which say "change permission of directories to 757 or 777". This is very security vulnerable so I won't recommend these solutions!

Check for the group on which apach runs
In the case of ubuntu server, it's written in /etc/apache2/envvars and says
export APACHE_RUN_USER=www-data
export APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data
so the group for apach is www-data.

Create directroy for images
$ mkdir /wp-contents/uploads

Change group of the directory to www-data
$ chgrp www-data /wp-contents/uploads

Add writable permission to the group
$ chmod g+w /wp-contents/uploads
or
$ chmod 775 /wp-contents/uploads
Changing the last digit of the permission to 7 is very dangerous because anyone will be able to edit the files.
